\chapter{An Analysis of the Intention for and Reception of TempleOS}

The objectives of this chapter are to first examine
the intentions of Terry A. Davis in the creation of TempleOS and, second,
to analyse its reception in various online communities.
I hope to show that although Davis was serious in his invention of TempleOS,
its religious content and motivations were dismissed
in the communities that expressed technical interest and, finally,
that although communities formed around Davis make frequent reference
to its religious content, they do so in jest.

\section*{Terry A. Davis, the prophet}

\begin{displayquote}
  I am Roman Catholic, and the religion for my kingdom
  would be Roman Catholic, but the church is dead [...].
  Right now the computer industry is sick like Herod,
  the Roman Church is sick like Herod,
  the world is sick like Herod, and I'm going to cure it.
\end{displayquote}

This was a proclamation made by Terry A. Davis \parencite*{NewReligion} in a video titled
\textit{I'm Starting a New Religion} uploaded a month before his death.
In it, Davis stands outside a church and speaks informally to the camera,
weaving between the topics of his religious mission,
and the beauty of the church beside him.

%  Still I hesistated and kept it secular until, finally,
%  Microsoft went nuclear with SecureBoot and UEFI.
%  Then, I went nuclear and named it "TempleOS".
%  I will command them on orders from God to UNDO THAT STUFF!
