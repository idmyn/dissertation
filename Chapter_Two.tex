\chapter{An Introduction to `Invented Religions'}

\section*{Introduction}
The objective of this chapter is to introduce the possibility of
`the sacred` being found in unexpected places.
First, an overview of Carol Cusack's vision of
the `invented religions' category will be provided.
Then, an exposition will be given of her example of Discordianism
which will segue into Kliever's discussion of religion and play
before finally a summary will be given of Demerath's observation
that `the sacred' might be found in non-religious places.

%provide an overview
%of the scholarship surrounding the `invented religions' category,
%beginning with Carol Cusack's \parencite*{Cusack10} vision, and
%moving on to consider the interlinked topic of non-religious
%sources of the sacred with reference to N. J. Demerath \parencite*{Demerath00}.

\section*{Exposition}
Normally, new religions employ various strategies
to defuse the otherwise troubling unfamiliarity
that might be felt by people encountering them for the first time.
Cusack refers to this as the
``web of conventions that surround the establishment of new religions'',
and notes that it typically involves
``arguing that the teaching is not really `new' but rather
a contemporary strand of ancient wisdom'',
or suggesting that scripture originates from
an authoritative external source, like God (1).
`Invented religions' are those which decline to employ these tactics,
instead choosing to openly declare their invented status.
This might be because they their beliefs are structured around
the content of a novel,
as in the case of the Church of All Worlds (53),
or because they emerged as a product of late-night discussion in
24-hour bowling alleys, in the case of Discordianism (28).

Cusack (1) invites us to see something ``deeply provocative''
about this invitation for us to recognise as `religion'
these movements which present themselves unashamedly as
products of the human imagination and yet, she argues,
``they can be seen to be functionally similar, if not identical, 
to traditional religions''
and ought thus to be taken seriously by scholars.
Furthermore, these movements inflame some of
the broadest questions asked by the academic study of religion,
sometimes even voicing these questions themselves.
In response to their listing on various websites as a `parody religion'
in 2001, Discordians began an email protest with one writer demanding
``that either you move us into the same category
as the rest of the religions, or tell me what the criteria [are]
to become a `real` religion so that I might show how Discordianism meets them''
\parencite[209]{Chidester05}.

We've covered the \textit{how}, now let's consider the \textit{why}.
Cusack \parencite*[7]{Cusack10} argues that ``invented religions are
exercises of the imagination that have developed in a creative
(though sometimes oppositional) partnership with the influential
popular cultural narratives of the contemporary West'',
and that this would not have been possible without
the development of secularisation, individualism, and consumer culture
``from the late nineteenth century to the present''.
Secularisation meant that  ``throughout the twentieth century
religious institutions had lost much of their influence'',
however there was also ``growth in new religious movements
in the post-war period'' (9).
Cusack \parencite[9]{Cusack10} points to Yves Lambert's observation that
these new religious movements, in their ``reinterpretation and innovation'', 
commonly exhibited the characteristics of
``worldliness, dehierachization of the human and the divine,
self-spirituality, [and] parascientificity'' \parencite[303]{Lambert99}.
Crucially, members of these new religious forms are less likely to ask
`is it true?', and more likely to ask `does it work?'.
It is in this mode that modern `seekers' are understood to operate in
a `spiritual marketplace' \parencite[13]{Cusack10}.
This is the environment in which invented religions 
such as Discordianism are born.

\section*{Discordianism}
Cusack (27) introduces Discordianism as 
``a religion devoted to Eris, the Greek goddess of chaos''
which spread, after its founding in 1957, ``through
the novels of Robert Anton Wilson [...] in the 1970s,
and through role-playing game clubs, science fiction fandom,
and the internet from the 1980s to the present''.
The religious `tradition' of writing scripture was upheld in Discordianism,
she notes, with the ``anarchic 'zine'' titled \textit{Principia Discordia}.
In light of their scripture's lack of sustained narrative, their teachings 
are ``complex and difficult to expound in an ordered fashion'' (29),
but include some internally consistent philosophical ideas
alongside some comically absurd statements.
For example, the \textit{Principia Discordia} in one place introduces the
`psycho-metaphysical' `Aneristic Principle' of apparent disorder,
explaining that ``ideas-about-reality are mistakenly labeled `reality'
and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that
other people, especially other cultures, see `reality' differently.
It is only the ideas-about-reality which differ'' \parencite[49]{Principia}.
One of its five commandments --- named `the Pentabarf' --- on the other hand,
insists that ``A Discordian shall Partake of No Hot Dog Buns'' (4).

\section*{Play}
Cusack \parencite*[23]{Cusack10} draws a useful connection between the
``persuasive discourse an artistic creativity [...] evident
from the beginnings of Discordianism'' and
Lonnie Kliever's 1981 article which concludes that
``artful argument and artistic vision are noncoercive and nonviolent ways
of fashioning consentual communities'' with the power to
``construe the universe `as if' it were humanely ordered and meaningful,
even though we know these construals are
`not really' true'' \parencite[665]{Kliever81}.
The crux of the argument in Kliever's article is that
in both play and religion we 
``contest and escape reality \textit{knowingly}'' (662),
that is, we `remember while forgetting' (660).

Religious belief-systems, Kliever argues,
are ``essentially fictive in character'' (658).
Put another way, they are
``symbolic constructs which \textit{cannot} be verified
and hence \textit{cannot be true}.
Contrastingly, `Facts' are
``symbolic constructions which have been established as
reliable representations of a world that actually does exist
independently of all human imagination and intervention'' (658).
This unverifiability does not diminish the value of religion,
however, as ``scientific knowledge and bureaucratic order
have not eradicated or satisfied human craving
for life-enhancing and death-defying symbols and rituals'' (658).
Humans have a need for `something more' than
the material reality before us, so the argument goes,
which only fictions can offer.
Kliever recognises the `inherent irony' in the proposition that
``illusion can triumph over reality for a time
even while it is known to be illusion'' (659),
but invites critics to consider the powerful analogy of play.

To introduce the concept of `remembering while forgetting'
in the context of play, Kliever points to the work of 
Gregory Bateson (1955 in Kliever 1981, 661),
who developed his theory upon an observation he made at a zoo.
Bateson observed two monkeys play-fighting and realised that
this phenomenon of apparent combat with both parties lacking
the intention to harm the other was only possible 
``with some degree of \textit{meta-communication}'',
essentially conveying the message 
``These actions in which we now engage do not denote
what those actions \textit{for which they stand} would denote'' (661).
In other words, to physically push somebody in jest,
one has to communicate that the action performed
is not an invitation for a fight, as might typically be the case.
Communicating this message involves reference to
a scenario that exists only hypothetically, and
performing an action that, taken at face value, is untrue (662).
For a playful shove to be succeed, however,
the recipient should receive it in good spirit, that is,
with an `unthinking' recognition of its playfulness.
The recipient must assess the intention behind the action enough
to realise it does not denote an invitation to fight,
but not much as to completely defuse the action
and lose sight of the playful provocation.
Put in Bateson's psychological terminology,
one must balance the primary process of thought which
avoids ``distinctions [...] between language and reality'',
and the secondary process of thought
which ``discriminat[es] between literal and figurative''
(Bateson in Kliever 1981, 662).
It is along these lines that Kliever argues that we can
employ religion as a primary process in tension with
the secondary process that criticises it as fiction.

\textit{Consider `remembering while forgetting' in Discordianism?}


\section*{Alternative sources of the sacred}
An obviously allied concept to that of invented religion
is the idea that `the sacred' might be sourced
from places other than religion.
N. J. Demerath \parencite*{Demerath00} gives a compelling presentation
of this, arguing \textit{blah}.
